This directory contains the new xml parser. It requires xsd: http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/

scenario.cxx and scenario.hxx are auto-generated by xsdcxx when make runs. Do not edit them!
They are generated from the scenario.xsd file in this directory.
When changing scenario.xsd, increment SCHEMA_VERSION in inputData.cpp, copy the new scenario.xsd file to ../test/original/scenario_VER.xsd, and update the java SchemaTranslator (in ../util). Changes to scenario.xsd can break compilation.

inputData.cpp is an (ineligant) bridge between scenario.hxx and the main simulation code. It shouldn't really contain any code interpreting parameters, but it does, because this code was already there or used to be in the parsing code (and cannot now because the parser is auto-generated). As far as I can see, inputData is an ugly bridge but not doing any harm.

See Makefile.am for the command used to generate the scenario C++ code.
