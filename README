Open Malaria

Licence: GPL v2 (see COPYING).



Dependencies:
GSL (GNU Scientific Library)
XSD (Code Synthesis XSD; debian package named xsdcxx)
BOINC
gzstream (included)

The build system expects some shared libraries in lib/ for static linking. E.g. for linux:
libboinc.a  libboinc_api.a  libgsl.a  libgslcblas.a  libxerces-c.a


Linux building:
./autogen
  If ./autogen fails run
  automake --add-missing
  and then repeat ./autogen
./configure [--enable-deployed]
	The --enable-deployed option adds BOINC integration and statically links the libraries.
make

To run tests, use:
make test
or:
./test.sh [test numbers]
./testCheckpointing.sh


Windows build

Note: Debug configuration is broken with a strange error. Someone has to fix this a soon as possible.

Prequisites:

    * Visual Studio .net
    * BOINC source code (http://boinc.berkeley.edu) to a directory name boinc in your workspace.
          o Build the BOINC libraries using the libboinc target in boinc\win_build\boinc.sln 
    * GSL. Version update to 1.11 see newGSLversion
    * Download Xerces C++ XML parser v3.0 from http://apache.mirror.testserver.li/xerces/c/3/sources/xerces-c-3.0.1.zip. Extract and follow build instructions at (http://xerces.apache.org/xerces-c/build-3.html). Build the XercesLib? target for both Static debug and Static release configurations.
          o Copy the files xerces-c_static_3D.lib from Build\Win32\VC8\StaticDebug? and xerces-c_static_3.lib from Build\Win32\VC8\StaticRelease? to project_dir/lib 
    * Install Code Synthesis' xsd
    * Debugging Tools for Windows
    * Download CodeSynthesis? XSD from http://codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/download.xhtml and follow the installation instructions 

How to build 

    * Open visual studio's options (Tools -> Options)
          o Goto Projects and solutions -> VC++ Directories
                + For executable files add:
                      # C:\Program Files\CodeSynthesis? XSD 3.2\bin (XSD bin dir) 
    * Check out openMalaria from google code. The Visual Studio project file makes the following assumptions:
          o BOINC is in the same directory as the project root directory, the root directory is called boinc 
    * Open malariaModel2005C++.sln
    * Select the Release configuration
    * Debug configuration is currently broken
