This folder has eclipse project files. In theory, you should be able to create a workspace in util, then add this directory as an existing project.

Copy any XML files to update into the scenarios/ folder, the run the application in eclipse (as java application).

Alternately, copy the XML files as above and run from the command-line:
java SchemaTranslator
(This avoids any eclipse problems at least.)
