Reporting requirements
===============


Longitudinal reporting
----------------------------------

Somehow track events/people. For simulating trials. So group data according to some event, such as:

*   recieves or doesn't recieve an ITN


Per-person reporting
--------------------------------

To simulate drug trials:

*   Want drug concentrations per person/treatment event something like 3, 7 and 14 days later
*   Want to know time until parasite clearance
