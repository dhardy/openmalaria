The following are clearly incompatible.

NEGATIVE_BINOMIAL_MASS_ACTION with LOGNORMAL_MASS_ACTION: they're versions of the same model-
component.

EMPIRICAL_WITHIN_HOST_MODEL with DUMMY_WITHIN_HOST_MODEL

Heterogeneity options with other heterogeneity options including any of the same components.


--------------------------------
The following do have some reason for being incompatible, which may be resolvable.

ANY_TRANS_HET (any HET components with transmission heterogeneity) with
NEGATIVE_BINOMIAL_MASS_ACTION and LOGNORMAL_MASS_ACTION: both adjust the availability-to-mosquitoes
factor. If these adjustments can be combined though they needn't be (see the following; currently
they're multiplied but because of the incompatibility one must be 1.0):
http://github.com/dhardy/openmalaria/blob/master/model/Host/Human.cpp#L137

Heterogeneity options with other heterogeneity options not including the same components. In some
cases this is allowed (any of the three individual hets together, which AR used), but in
some cases it's not (one of the individual hets with the paired het of the other two components).
I don't see a reason for this, but neither a reason for worrying about it.

EMPIRICAL_WITHIN_HOST_MODEL has a requirement on INCLUDES_PKPD, though this isn't in principle
required (to confirm in code).


------------------------------------
In the following one option is rendered irrelevant by another, which in a way is an incompatibility.
They are included in the incompatibility check to prevent users from thinking they provide another
model version, except for MAX_DENS_CORRECTION which is enabled by default.

ATTENUATION_ASEXUAL_DENSITY with DUMMY_WITHIN_HOST_MODEL, INCLUDES_PK_PD
(ATTENUATION_ASEXUAL_DENSITY only meaningful with IPT model which is incompatible with the others)

INNATE_MAX_DENS with DUMMY_WITHIN_HOST_MODEL

MAX_DENS_CORRECTION with DUMMY_WITHIN_HOST_MODEL, EMPIRICAL_WITHIN_HOST_MODEL (not marked incompatible)


---------------------------------
As further documentation, the following were once marked incompatible but neither TS nor DH can see
why they need be incompatible.

MUELLER_PRESENTATION_MODEL with NON_MALARIA_FEVERS
Note: untested, but code looks OK with the combination.

INCLUDES_PK_PD with PENALISATION_EPISODES
Note: these (drug treatment modelling and immunity penalisation) aren't necessarily totally independant.

PENALISATION_EPISODES with DUMMY_WITHIN_HOST_MODEL: the immunity code is now common to all within-
host models so no longer relevant.

INCLUDES_PK_PD with PENALISATION_EPISODES, MAX_DENS_CORRECTION, INNATE_MAX_DENS

ANY_TRANS_HET (any HET components with transmission heterogeneity) with ATTENUATION_ASEXUAL_DENSITY,
NO_PRE_ERYTHROCYTIC, MAX_DENS_CORRECTION
